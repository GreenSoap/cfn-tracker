Thanks to [Sheldon](https://www.twitch.tv/SheldonTwitching) for testing this release and for the encouragement and support!

Expect the next major release when Street Fighter 6 comes out, until then it's patch work ðŸ’¯

## [2.0.0] - 2023-01-12

This is the rewrite of the CFN Tracker I wrote almost 4 years ago. It contains many improvements and I hope to add even more features to it in time!

### Added
- Rewrote the app in Go + [Rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod), since [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) and [CasperJS](https://github.com/casperjs/casperjs) are no longer maintained

### Fixed
- App is now shipped as a single binary instead of having to download PhantomJS + CasperJS.
