# FAQ

## Can I use this for my stream?
Yes absolutely! If you do, let us know and we'll feature you here ðŸ’ª

## Can I use this for my own without streaming?
Yes! Quite a few people have also told us that peeking at their stats as they play has kept them motivated!

## I can't open CFN Tracker on Mac
If the app doesn't open for you, right click the app > *Show package contents* > *Contents* > *MacOS* > double click *CFN Tracker*

## Why is the download link broken?
The installer was disabled when SF6 came out to avoid confusion, since the app only supported SFV.

## Is it possible to use the CFN Tracker as an API?
It hasn't been ruled out, but it's not something we're gonna work on in the forseeable future due to the difference in scope of a service like this.

## How did you make this?
You can read about it [here](https://www.williamsjokvist.se/cases/cfn-tracker) once it's done...
