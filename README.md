# CFN Scraper
This tool tracks any CFN account for its ranked match wins, losses, rank, LP as well as LP gain (since the tracking started)

### Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain during a session.

### Usage

* Download the executable for your operating system from the Releases page
* Launch the executable
* On first launch the program will prompt for a CFN to track; this is then saved to `cfn-scraper-config.toml` in the same location. It can be edited later.

Text files will be generated in a `results` folder after every match is played. Use them as sources for your labels and they'll update after every match.
