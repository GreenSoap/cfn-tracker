# CFN Scraper
This tool scrapes any CFN profile for its wins, losses, rank, LP as well as your Net LP.

### Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain during a session.

### Configuration and setting it up

* Get [PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/download.html) and put the .exe in the master directory. 
* Get [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) and put the "casperjs" folder in the directory as well. 
* Set up a Steam account with Steam Guard **disabled** â€“ this is because logging in is required to view CFN profiles. :unamused:
* In the _config.ini_ you will need to specify the Steam ID and Password for the account, as well as the target CFN account.
* You have the options to output the result to individual .txt files as well as a JSON in case you wanna do some fancy stuff ^^
* After you've configured it to your liking, launch the .bat file. Add some text labels in OBS and use the generated .txt files as sources. The labels will then automatically update after a match.

### Example

![stream](showcase/streamexample.gif?raw=true "streamshowcase")

### Result

This is how the batch file will display the data:
![screenshot](showcase/batchscreenshot.GIF?raw=true "screenshot")


Here's what the JSON looks like:
```
{
   "account":{
      "rank":0,
      "lp":0,
      "net":"0"
   },
   "rank":{
      "wins":0,
      "losses":0,
      "ratio":"0%"
   },
   "casual":{
      "wins":0,
      "losses":0,
      "ratio":"0%"
   },
   "lounge":{
      "wins":0,
      "losses":0,
      "ratio":"0%"
   }
}
```
