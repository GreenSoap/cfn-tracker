# CFN Tracker
This tool tracks any Street Fighter V CFN account's live match statistics. 

## Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain and other statistics during a session.

## Support

If you find the tool useful for your streams or otherwise, consider [buying me a coffee â˜•](https://ko-fi.com/greensoap)

## Usage

* Download the app for either Mac or Windows from [the download page](https://greensoap.github.io/cfn-tracker/).
* Launch it and wait for it to finish initializing.
* Input your CFN when prompted and start.

Text files will be generated in a `results` folder, which are updated after every match. Use them as sources for your labels in e.g. OBS.

All of the logged matches are listed in the `Match Log` tab, and can be filtered by character, date, league and opponent.

The app has translations for `English`, `French` and `Japanese`.

The app will start with a notification if an update has released. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GreenSoap_) for update tweets.
