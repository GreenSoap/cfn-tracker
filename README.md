# CFN Tracker
This tool tracks any Street Fighter V CFN account's live match statistics. 

### Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain and other statistics during a session.

### Support

If you find the tool useful for your streams or to become a better player, consider [buying me a coffee â˜•](https://ko-fi.com/greensoap)

### Usage

* Download the executable for either Mac or Windows from the [Releases](https://github.com/GreenSoap/cfn-tracker/releases) page.
* Execute the app and wait for it to initialize.
* Input your CFN when prompted.

Text files will be generated in a `results` folder for every match played. Use them as sources for your labels and watch the labels be automatically updated after every match.

All of the logged matches are listed in the `Match Log` tab, and can be filtered by character, date and opponent.

The app has translations for English, French and Japanese - as these are big regions for Street Fighter.
