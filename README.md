# CFN Scraper
This tool scrapes any CFN profile for its wins, losses, rank, LP as well as your Net LP.

### Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain during a session.

### Usage

* Download the zip file from the Releases page and unzip it to an appropriate location
* Set your CFN name in `config.toml` 
* Add your CFN name to the file
* Launch the executable `scraper.exe`

.txt files will be generated in a folder called "result". Use them as sources for your labels and they'll update after every match.

### Example

![stream](showcase/streamexample2.gif?raw=true "streamshowcase")

### Result

This is how the batch file will display the data:
![screenshot](showcase/screenie.gif?raw=true "screenshot")
