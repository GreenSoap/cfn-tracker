# CFN Tracker
This tool tracks any Street Fighter V CFN account's live match statistics. 

### Who is this for? 
This is primarily targeted toward streamers who want automatically updated win/loss counters. It can also be useful if you wanna keep track of your LP gain and other statistics during a session.

### Support

If you find the tool useful for your streams or otherwise, consider [buying me a coffee â˜•](https://ko-fi.com/greensoap)

### Usage

* Download the app for either Mac or Windows from the [Releases](https://github.com/GreenSoap/cfn-tracker/releases) page.
* Launch it and wait the initialization to finish.
* Input your CFN when prompted.

Text files will be generated in a `results` folder, and are automatically updated after every match. Use them as sources for your labels in e.g. OBS.

All of the logged matches are listed in the `Match Log` tab, and can be filtered by character, date and opponent.

The app has translations for English, French and Japanese.

The app will start with a notification if an update has released. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GreenSoap_) for update tweets.

### Development

Coming updates
* Optional web output, so you can add it as a browser source in OBS
* Themes for said web output, with easy customization of layout, font, font size and colors
* Street Fighter 6 support
